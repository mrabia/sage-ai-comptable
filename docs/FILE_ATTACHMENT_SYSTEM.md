    },
    body: JSON.stringify({
        message: "Analyze this invoice and check against Sage records",
        conversation_id: 123,
        attached_files: [456] // File IDs
    })
});
```

## 🎭 Example Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Invoice Analysis
```
User: "I've uploaded an invoice. Can you verify it against our Sage records?"

System Response:
📄 Analyzing invoice_2024_001.pdf
💰 Amounts detected: 1,250.00€ (total), 1,041.67€ (net), 208.33€ (VAT)
🧾 Reference: INV-2024-001
✅ Match found in Sage: Invoice INV-2024-001 for 1,250.00€
✅ Customer: ABC Corp matches
⚠️ Due date discrepancy: File shows 2024-03-15, Sage shows 2024-03-20
💡 Recommendation: Update due date in Sage system
```

### Scenario 2: Bank Statement Processing
```
User: "Please analyze this bank statement and reconcile with Sage"

System Response:
📊 Bank statement analysis complete
💳 45 transactions found
✅ 38 transactions matched with Sage payments
⚠️ 7 unreconciled transactions (total: 2,847.50€)
🔍 Largest unreconciled: 1,200.00€ on 2024-03-10
💡 Recommendation: Review unreconciled items for missing entries
